 
Sync In Bug Reporting
==============

Please use this repository to report bugs for [Sync In](www.syncin.app)


Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with [Sync In](www.syncin.app).  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while using Sync In](www.syncin.app), first search the [issue list](https://github.com/aparekh5/sync-in-bug-reporting/issues) to see if it has already been reported.

If your issue has been reported, please upvote the issue by clicking the "Add Reaction" button (smiley face with a plus sign) on the root post and adding a thumbs up. Voting helps us determine which issues are important to users without cluttering the bug database. Duplicate issue reports may be closed without comment.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the browser console in a [gist](https://gist.github.com);
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
